Hello! Glad to see you here!

I'm Sergey. I like things that work and look beautiful. I like to build things that work and look beautiful. And also, I like to learn the ins and outs of why things work and look beautiful. I like to contribute to the projects that have meaning and stand out. I like to teach and learn. I'm one of those who unites people into groups rather than divides them into ones. I like to make this world a better place.
